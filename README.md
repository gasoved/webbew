#### Web/bew - My First Personal Website

I've built websites in as back as 2002, but this is my first personal website from 2009. It was a PHP website. I got it into a workable state, converted from PHP to static, left broken English and all other stuff intact.

The idea of personal websites and nostalgia of good old days come up on Hacker News from time to time (Here is a quick search: https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=true&query=personal%20website&sort=byPopularity&type=story). It is that what put the idea of reviving it in back of my mind.
